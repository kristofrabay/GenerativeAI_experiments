{"prompt":"Does not lay flat. Creased beyond usefulness.. I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED THIS PRODUCT BUT THE RETURN WINDOW RAN OUT. The liner comes folded and does not lay flat. I thought that if I left it out, the material would eventually relax and become flat. It has been out a week and it I still all rippled. Why would the manufacturer not ship it in a tube or wrapped around a tube!!!! This liner is useless. What a joke. Do not buy. ->","completion":" negative"}

{"prompt":"Sturdy and Attractive. This is the second one of these that I have purchased. It is an excellent platform for a foam or conventional mattress. It is totally sturdy, and looks nice. I highly recommend it. There are many frames out there that will cost you much more, but this does the trick. ->","completion":" positive"}

{"prompt":"Small!!. This product is very small. The pictures are very deceptive and although I haven’t used them yet, I’m beginning to think this was a rip off because the price should be less due to the very small size of these. They’re only as wide as my pinky finger and as long as my index finger. ->","completion":" negative"}
{"prompt":"These are no good!. Im not sure if its just this sellers stock of this product or what but the first order was no good, each bottle had mold and clumps in the bottle and usually companies will put a couple of metal beads in a bottle to aid in the mixing but these had a rock in it... like a rock off the ground. I decided to replace the item, same seller, and once again they were all clumpy and gross... I attached a photo. I wouldnt buy these, at least not from this seller. ->","completion":" negative"}

{"prompt":"Nice Quality -- They fit the Bill. I'm very happy with these scissors. They are small (as most have stated) but are super sharp. The finger slots are great and feel like a smooth soft rubber. I didn't want to have large scissors dangling and getting caught on things as I like to wear my scissors on a badge pulley on my waste band for quick use in the ER. These fit the bill for cutting fabric tape, bandages and even clothing items. The bent edge makes it easy to get them in where I need. I'm glad I got them. ->","completion":" positive"}

{"prompt":"This holster is not good for the Note 8 (and probably Note 9 and Note 10).. What a disappointment. If you have a Note 8, and you use any type of protective plastic on it, you may not be able to close the holster with the zipper. It will definitely not close with an Otterbox case. A smaller case may allow you to close, but it if it does, it will be a very tight fit. I'll see if I have another use for this holster. If not, I'll return it, and if I do return it, I expect the shipping costs to be covered by Amazon. ->","completion":" negative"}

{"prompt":"A good read!. Lucas. This book was interesting. I was surprised at how determined Lucas was to make Jasmine his. The issues Jasmine carried around kept her from having a relationship with any man. But Lucas wasn't taking no for an answer. I am glad she found out who her father was even though it was a shocker ! This book was a great read! *** I voluntarily read a Review Copy of this book. All opinions stated are solely my own and no one else’s. *** ->","completion":" positive"}

{"prompt":"Zero magnetic hold. I was excited to replace my iPad cover with this one as it says in the description that it has \"Ultra strong built-in magnets holds the folded front cover panels firmly to stand the iPad Air 2 and let you enjoy iPad Air 2 without holding it\"... well, in my humble opinion there is zero magnetic hold when trying to fold the cover into a stand... once I set it down, it stands up fine... but as soon as I pick it back up the cover unfolds with no-resistance. Otherwise quality seems good. ->","completion":" negative"}
{"prompt":"Too shallow to protect the screen. I had this case ready for my new iPhone 11 Pro, which came today. The case fits around the phone nicely, but the screen sits proud of the case (above) instead of having a protective lip. In other words, if you put the phone\/case face down on a table, the screen touches the table. If you have a screen protector on your phone (which you should!) it'll be even more pronounced. They just need to adjust the manufacturing parameters to make the case deeper; otherwise it's a solid case. Unfortunately, I'm going to return it and find a case that protects the screen properly. ->","completion":" negative"}
{"prompt":"Two Stars. Has a chaulky taste. ->","completion":" negative"}

{"prompt":"Great way to freshen up old furniture.. I used this product to cover the drawers of an old dresser. Now it looks very chic and expensive. I would definitely recommend this product to others. I used a felt covered applicator (just search Amazon for wallpaper kit) and I didn't encounter any bubbles with the product. Very easy to use if you have the right tools. ->","completion":" positive"}
{"prompt":"Great concept but some flaws. I really like the concept of this belt and how it works. As a plus size person I find this belt easy to use and tighten. But I am giving a two star review for two reasons. 1) the buckle is very heavy for its size. Not sure if it’s how it is designed but feels heavy and bulky 2) the class that holds the buckle on slips. I like my belt tight but the teeth just dig in and the “leather” just pulls and stretches. ->","completion":" negative"}
{"prompt":"Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth!. I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale. ->","completion":" negative"}
{"prompt":"Touchy. All the subjects of this book are very delicate, touchy. They are definitely subjects that need to be addressed and this author, Deborah Rainey, does it in a Godly way.

{"prompt":"Bands in Cartridge Ink. So after finally sitting down to print some documents I found that the cartridge has bands in it. tried walking through all the instructions on cleaning it however if a state that if it doesn't work then more than likely that cartridge needs to be replaced. So it was a waste of $100 on this ink. I WONT be buying from this seller ever again ->","completion":" negative"}

{"prompt":"Super cute, entirely unusable as oven mits. I really wanted to like these. So cute hanging on a hook on my fridge! Unfortunately that's all they are good for. There's no thumbs and they don't bend, so it's really impractical to pick anything up. ->","completion":" negative"}

{"prompt":"It seems to chase away my ant problem. I have seen a few ants around my apartment almost every day recently, so I bought this little device to see if it works. It is actually pretty effective. I have not seen any ants for days now. It is so easy to use. I just plugged it into my electrical outlet and it works just like that. It even has a small blue LED light, which looks quite bright at night. One downside is that it would take up 2 slot on your outlet as the device is quite long (about 4-inch long and 2-inch wide). It is also effective for small area. If you have a big house, they recommend to have one for each room, which will add up quite a lot of money. Overall, it works well for my small apartment. ->","completion":" positive"}

It has held up remarkable well despite repeated use and is aesthetically pleasing to boot. The only difficulty, putting this bad boy together. Plan to put some time aside to follow the picture book instructions that appear to have been drawn by graphically challenged individuals with cataracts. Also, to increase the sturdiness of the wood pegs (used to hold certain pieces together) I used wood glue. All in all, good little set up. Would definitely recommend. ->","completion":" positive"}

My daughter and I represent two generations of women who married their best friends.; and my granddaughter just announced that she and her best friend are starting to date! My last name is Barker(a name given to me by my late husband). I nearly gave up on this book because this Brooke was broken. She wasn't quirky, she was just queer!
