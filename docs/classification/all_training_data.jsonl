{"prompt":"Works as intended on 2006 Honda Accord sedan. 2006 Honda Accord sedan. Had a difficult time trying to install unit. Fully assembled, the unit was not fitting into the small space. The arms were hitting and I could not get it to go in. Not sure if this is the way to go, but I disconnected the rod from the motor gear so I could \"flatten\" out the linkage. Once I did this the unit slid into place very easily. The only hard part was reconnecting the arm to the motor gear. You have just enough room to fit your fingers in behind the linkage. Then you have to press, HARD, to get it to \"snap\" into place on the ball. Other than that issue, everything seemed to go smoothly.","completion":"positive"}

{"prompt":"Doesn't actually do any air \"cleaning\". Bought this as a humidifier, the \"air cleaning\" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something. As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.","completion":"negative"}

Just what we wanted. I would ask folks to understand that this light is really for home use and does not illuminate a large area on the ground. As it is mounted on top of the pole the circumference of light is smaller and stronger at the top while larger and weaker on the ground. Thus don't expect your flag and pole to be lit like a government building. If you want that, buy a different commercial grade light.","completion":"positive"}

I did knock off a star because the instructions are really annoyingly unclear and while mine are stable and working fine I'm still not sure I installed them exactly as intended.

But, one question I plan to write the seller is: Because we are not lifting up some thing that is centered, the lift developed a side to side looseness that I want to fix. I try to get my wife's feet in the center but the leaning load is taking its toll on the lift. If I was lifting a motorcycle I can't say enough good about it.","completion":"positive"}

{"prompt":"Not worth returning not worth rebuying. This purchase is a gift for someone that has been unopened so my review is based on my experiences with the product. My first issue in this experience is pricing. From this listing it costs about store price (still too much), but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason. It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates. This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys. I'm sure this young kid will have fun with it, but all factors included it isn't worth returning and also not worth rebuying.","completion":"positive"}

The case fits around the phone nicely, but the screen sits proud of the case (above) instead of having a protective lip. In other words, if you put the phone\/case face down on a table, the screen touches the table. If you have a screen protector on your phone (which you should!) it'll be even more pronounced. They just need to adjust the manufacturing parameters to make the case deeper; otherwise it's a solid case. Unfortunately, I'm going to return it and find a case that protects the screen properly.","completion":"negative"}

{"prompt":"Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth!. I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication.

I can do it, but it takes quite a bit of pressure to make it \"click.\" Other than that, I've dropped the phone a couple times and this case has protected it very well. It's really grippy, which I love, and isn't so thick that the phone won't fit in a holster. And I love the super-visible color, which makes it difficult to misplace my phone.

The same goes with the fingers and the Large gloves aren't very large any more and I had to struggle to get my not-so-fleshy fingers into the gloves.

It even has a small blue LED light, which looks quite bright at night. One downside is that it would take up 2 slot on your outlet as the device is quite long (about 4-inch long and 2-inch wide). It is also effective for small area. If you have a big house, they recommend to have one for each room, which will add up quite a lot of money.

Not sure why everyone says to size up, as there is a plenty of extra material... It\u2019s made to be a baggy crop top.

{"prompt":"Looks nice, but for how long?. The product looks nice and will do what it's intended for, but it arrived with scratches in the acrylic which make me question how long before it looks like trash. Shelf inserts were a nice touch though.","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"Perfect for backless dress. This worked perfectly for a backless dress. I\u2019m so glad I picked this one!","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"Mirrors will fall down if you use provided adhesive stickers. Adhesive stickers are completely defective. Mirrors fell off on their own with enough time, and shattered.","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"Please check the date before expire!. I don\u2019t like it because i ordered twice they sent me the one expired. No good .I don\u2019t want to buy anymore.","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"Too small. This product did not arrive as described. Only tried on the top and it is WAY to small, not consistent with measurements shown. I don\u2019t think I was sent the correct item and there\u2019s not option to return for correct item. Disappointed!","completion":"negative"}

{"prompt":"Not a fan. Did not work for me. Too big in the midsection, and too short. Not a flattering look at all.","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"Super cool smart lights. We recently purchased an Amazon echo Dot so we are slowly adding more and more smart devices to our home and figured this would be the perfect start. These smart lightbulbs have been so much fun and work wonderful with Alexa. The installation was a breeze and we haven't had any issues so far. The color are bright and there are so many options. I'm actually thinking about getting another pack for the other rooms in our house.","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"Does what it's supposed to do. This little guy works right out of the box. No formatting required. There is a music folder already on the device so, just drag and drop your music in that folder or you can re-create the folder and name it something else. Once the music is on there, using the interface you can choose different ways to access that music (shuffle, accessing the folders directly or playing all the songs). The device itself is very light, think and can easily fit in your pocket. Not much to it really. It comes with a cable that allows you to connect to the computer to be able to put music, video or books on the device. It is also used to charge the device. It comes with headphones as well, which are pretty cheap but get the job done. My only gripe with the device is that even though it is light, it does feel like I can break this thing if I sneeze. Doesn't feel durable. But, all in all, great device for the prices.","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"I can't believe this story is this short!. I wasn't paying attention and was utterly dismayed to realize this thing is 20 pages. I read the whole thing, thinking it was a sample from a book, and then suddenly no more. I need more!!","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"It works better. Very good product I realy love it","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"Did not work for very long. Worked nicely for 2 weeks but now it doesn't always charge. When it did charge, it was as fast as using a normal USB cable but usually 20-30 minutes slower than a fast charge cable directly plugged into the phone. I like the upright design of it but I recommend investing more money in a higher quality product.","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"Very nice addition. Worked without a hitch right out of the box. Didn\u2019t have any issues. If it continues to function, it\u2019s a great buy...cheaper than the iDevice I have...","completion":"positive"}

{"prompt":"COOL BUT SMALL. I measured my dogs necks so I could buy the correct size- they were 10 inches exact. Technically the XS was their correct size, but it would have been super tight.","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"Good while it lasted. The case was great and does exactly what it's supposed to do until the plastic holding the tablet started to disintegrate. I've had this cover since November and in December the corners started breaking. I showed it to my husband just to make sure I wasn't seeing things. As he was holding it plastic from one corner fell off into his hand. I now have 3 corners that are coming apart. Bought two more of these cases and both have the plastic corners cracking and crumbling off.","completion":"negative"}

{"prompt":"They catch nothing..... These are horrible and catch nothing. Nothing.","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"Good deal for the price. For the price, this is a great deal. I'm a little nervous about reviews saying the turntable stopped working - Hoping I won't need to use it for long, as my intent is to transfer all vinyl and cassettes to my computer. If you want to hook up speakers to the unit, you'll need to use speakers that connect via the headphone jack - most computer speaker sets would work.","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"Not as bright as expected!. It has only one LED bulb on each spotlight. Other comparable products have four bulbs each. I thought this could still work but the amount of light it\u2019s on is only around 3 hours a night. I\u2019m returning this.","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"Good buy. Loved them. Use every day","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"Lightweight. Love the color, BUT.... Love the color-teal.. When you wash it has a TONS of lint. Once dried looks great. Love that it is 100% cotton. I'm hoping the next wash will not have alot of lint.","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"Cheap key, but isn\u2019t easy. Good price, keyway doesn\u2019t fit for my \u201816 Veloster like they tried to say it would. They also claimed you could program the key online? But I had to have a locksmith program it and he needed a PIN from my Hyundai dealer in town","completion":"negative"}

{"prompt":"One Star. Lots of static. Can barely hear my music","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"Sturdy Little Kitchen Play Set - Time consuming Set up tho...... Bought this for my children to play with, all under the age of five. It has held up remarkable well despite repeated use and is aesthetically pleasing to boot. The only difficulty, putting this bad boy together. Plan to put some time aside to follow the picture book instructions that appear to have been drawn by graphically challenged individuals with cataracts. Also, to increase the sturdiness of the wood pegs (used to hold certain pieces together) I used wood glue. All in all, good little set up. Would definitely recommend.","completion":"positive"}

{"prompt":"A+. Easy to clean. Great length for my toddler!","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"Bark box super chewers. it's been only one day and already my dog has destroyed two of the toys . My dog only weighs 30 lbs and is of medium build. Rope toys are completely useless against a dog's teeth therefore I will not be ordering anymore bark boxes","completion":"negative"}

{"prompt":"sizing off. Isn't a child small size","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"Works fantastic. Great to refurbish a compacted lawn. Assembly is a pain but this is heavy duty and not cheaply built. Local hard ware store visit is needed to buy blocks for weighting down. It tore up my clay perfectly with deep plugs. Down side is getting on and off the lawn mower to raise\/lower the times when coming to a driveway or sidewalk.","completion":"positive"}
{"prompt":"Be careful and make sure you check the sizing. Had I know that this item was this small I would never have paid more than $5.00 for this product. I could\u2019ve gotten these at Target for half the price I paid. What a waste!","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"This does not stick well or weed well!. The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you\u2019re finished weeding! It\u2019s so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they\u2019re aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it\u2019s okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate \ud83d\ude0f Possibly it\u2019s old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don\u2019t either!","completion":"negative"}
{"prompt":"Being Brooke. I had two reasons to love Being Brooke. I like watching best friends fall in love! My daughter and I represent two generations of women who married their best friends.; and my granddaughter just announced that she and her best friend are starting to date! My last name is Barker(a name given to me by my late husband). I nearly gave up on this book because this Brooke was broken. She wasn't quirky, she was just queer! The only thing I could work out about her was on the autism spectrum. That's understandable! Crazy for no reason is not!","completion":"positive"}
