If your flight is cancelled or delayed by two hours or more, RyanAir will give you information on your rights, including your rights to compensation and assistance. If RyanAir cannot land at the booked destination airport and is diverted to another airport, then unless the plane continues to the original destination airport after the diversion, the carriage by air will be considered to be completed when the plane arrives at that other airport. However, RyanAir will arrange alternative transport, with them or another transport provider they choose, to carry you to the destination airport set out in your booking confirmation or itinerary. You will not have to pay anything for that alternative transport. If RyanAir does not let you board the plane for a flight you have booked because a space is no longer available, they will compensate you in line with any relevant law that applies. They will give you information about your rights in these circumstances, particularly your rights relating to practical help and compensation. [ryanair_conditions.pdf-page-16]\n",

If you cancel your booking up to the fourteenth day prior to the scheduled time of departure of your flight, you will be entitled to a refund of the total fare after deduction of the cancellation fee. If you cancel your booking within fourteen days prior to the scheduled time of departure of your flight, you will be refunded the amount of the total fare after deduction of the fee for other services and the seat protection fee. You can change your flight to another available Wizz Air flight if you pay the associated service fee plus the fare difference, if any, for your new flight. This is calculated when you make the change. If the new fare is lower than the original, the difference will not be refunded. [wizzair_conditions.pdf-page-18][wizzair_conditions.pdf-page-28]\n",

However, please note that you are unable to cancel your booking less than 2 hours before the scheduled departure time of the first flight (even if within 24 hours of making the booking). If you need to cancel due to a serious or terminal illness, you are required to complete and submit a Medical Declaration document.

If a flight is cancelled or delayed by two hours or more, RyanAir will give passengers information on their rights, including their rights to compensation and assistance. If RyanAir cannot land at the booked destination airport and is diverted to another airport, they will arrange alternative transport to carry passengers to the destination airport set out in their booking confirmation or itinerary, and passengers will not have to pay anything for that alternative transport. All amounts paid for flights operated by RyanAir are non-refundable, except where clauses 4.2, 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4 of the terms apply. If RyanAir does not let a passenger board the plane for a flight they have booked because a space is no longer available, RyanAir will compensate the passenger in line with any relevant law that applies.\n",
